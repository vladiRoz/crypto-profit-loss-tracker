# crypto-profitloss-tracker
Android app that tracks your crypto investments profit loss on Bittrex exchange

Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=status.portfolio.crypto.vladi.cryptoportfoliostatus

Bittrex has no in-house app and web login isn't very quick because of 2FA, this can be frustrating when you only want to check your profit/loss. All of these motivated me to develop this lightweight app to track your crypto investments.

To start tracking your portfolio just add manually your invested coins and average buy-in. The App doesn't need your private api keys or any credentials so its totally secure and only uses Bittrex public api.

The app is still in development, features/tasks coming in the future:
Alarms, 
Binance exchange support, 
bug fixes, 
ui improvments

Tech/libs used:
Kotlin and only Kotlin, 
Retrofit, 
RxJava, 
Room Persistence, 
Streams

depandency injection with Dagger in dev.
